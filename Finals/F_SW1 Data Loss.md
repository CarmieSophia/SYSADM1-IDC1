**SYSADM1 -- Data Loss**

Instruction/s:

Read and analyze the data loss scenarios provided. Create a data
recovery plan by providing impact assessment,

recovery plan and preventive measures for each scenario. Lastly, answer
the reflection question.

**Evaluation Criteria Guide:**

1\. Impact Assessment:

> • Accurately identifies the potential consequences of the data loss.
>
> • Quantifies the potential financial, operational, and reputational
> impact.

2\. Recovery Plan:

> • Proposes a detailed, feasible, and timely recovery plan.
>
> • Includes steps for data restoration, system recovery, and business
> continuity.
>
> • Identifies the necessary resources and personnel.

3\. Preventive Measures:

> • Recommends specific measures to prevent similar incidents in the
> future.
>
> • Addresses potential vulnerabilities in security, hardware, and
> software.
>
> • Proposes regular backups, security audits, and employee training.
>
> • Recommends appropriate RAID levels for data redundancy and
> performance.
